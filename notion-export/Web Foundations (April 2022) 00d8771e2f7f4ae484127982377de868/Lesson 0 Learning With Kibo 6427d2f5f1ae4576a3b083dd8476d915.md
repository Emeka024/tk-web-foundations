## Before you start...

At Kibo we love learning together!

## Learning with Kibo

Kibo is different from other classes you have been a part of.

- Kibo is an online program. That means that **you’re in charge of your own learning**.
- A lot of the learning is **asynchronous:** you go at your own pace. There is a **weekly live class** everyone will attend, and weekly assignments everyone will submit.
- Get ready for a challenging journey. You need to **schedule lots of practice time.** Learning to code takes time!
- We love learning to code together. Once the program starts, you’ll **work with partners and groups**.

We want everyone who enrolls in Kibo to be successful. Therefore, before you can fully enroll in the program, we want to check that Kibo-style learning works for you. That’s why we want you to read these pages, set up your tools, and complete the assignment.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After this Lesson, you will be able to:

- Use **Replit** and **Notion** to learn with Kibo
- Use the **developer tools** built into the browser
- Learn about the **debugging** **mindset** for learning to program
