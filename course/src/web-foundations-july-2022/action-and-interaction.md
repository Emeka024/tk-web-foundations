# Action and interaction

*Estimated time: 6 hours*

---

This is the reading material, practice challenges, and assignment for week 4. 

## Intro

In previous classes, we’ve learnt how HTML and CSS can be combined to build cool websites. This week, we'll shift focus to JavaScript, and how to make your site interactive. 

As a bonus, we’ll also be delving into the tools and technologies you can use to publish and share your website with others. 

## **Learning Outcomes**

After this week, you will be able to:

- Use the console to experiment with JavaScript on a page
- Write JavaScript to make changes on the page in response to user actions

And if you have time to do the bonus:
- Publish your website using Replit or Github Pages
- Use HTML tags to control the preview when you share the link to your site
- Set up a domain name, so that your site shows up when someone types in the URL like [devtools.programming.africa](https://devtools.programming.africa/)
