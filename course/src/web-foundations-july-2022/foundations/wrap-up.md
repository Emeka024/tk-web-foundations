üôãüèø **What‚Äôs a squad rep?**    

Squad reps are students who help to maintain a supportive Kibo community. It‚Äôs a way for you to help your squad successfully reach the finish line of this program.

The responsibilities of a squad rep include things like checking in with squad members every week to see how they are progressing, relaying feedback to the Kibo team, and helping squad members feel like they belong and can rise to the challenge when things get tough.
