# Project: Your “CS Professor” Home Page

**Due date: Sunday, May 1st**

<aside>


👥 This is a team project. Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also allowed to work on your own, but it’s good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammate’s version (**which you all created together**!).

👩🏾‍🏫 **CS Professor Home Page**

This project is a chance to show off your creativity! You'll create a “CS Professor” web page using fundamental HTML elements.

**Access** and **submit** the project in Replit here: <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://replit.com/team/tk5-web/CS-Professor-Home-Page" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions tab in Replit
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
