## Navigating the lessons in Notion

Lessons are here in Notion. They will be released once a week on Monday morning.

Each lesson includes:

- An **overview** page explaining what the week is about
- A page for each of the key **concepts** in the lesson
- A page of üèãüèø¬†**Practice** exercises
- A ‚úÖ¬†**Project** with details about work you must submit. Your projects all have due dates.
- A üéÅ¬†**Wrap-up** page that includes a summary of the lesson and a chance for you to give us feedback.
    
    *Feedback is a gift, and we appreciate hearing from you!*
    

You can use the top navigation bar (highlighted in the below image) and the links at the bottom of each page, to navigate through the lessons.

The overview page for each lesson will also have links to each of the other pages for that week.

## Practice and Model Solutions

Each week, there is a page of **Practice** problems. Practice problems are your chance to put what you‚Äôve learned into action. Try solving the challenges to check that you understand the concepts.

Some practice problems have **Model Solutions**. If you click 'Submit' on the assignment, you can view the model solution from the assignments page. See the video below to see how to view the model solutions.

Some practice problems also have **video solutions.** The video solution will be next to the Practice assignment in Notion.

## Projects

Each week, you will have a required project. Usually, you‚Äôll need to work on it with other members of your squad. **Be sure to read the whole project page and submit all parts of each project!**

All projects will have:

- A link to **Replit** to submit your work
- **Instructions** for what to do
- A **rubric** explaining what successful work looks like

### Types of Projects

**Solo Projects** are for you to work on by yourself. You should ask for help if you get stuck, but the solution you submit is your own.

**Team Projects** are for you to work on with one or two other classmates. You should use Discord to find teammates and find time to work together. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammate‚Äôs version (**which you all created together!**).

## **Live Classes**

**Live Classes** are your chance to practice what you‚Äôve learned and get feedback from your TA. Each class will have a mix of demonstration from the TA, independent work alone or in pairs, and then group programming and problem solving.

Working with peers, getting feedback on your code, and asking questions are all core parts of the Kibo learning experience. 

- Please show up to Live Classes **prepared and on time**.
- Since you will be writing code as part of the class, you should **attend from your laptop, not a mobile phone.**
- Because they are meant to be interactive, Live Classes will usually **not be recorded**.
- Classes are a chance to practice your skills, not learn new material.

## Office Hours

Office Hours are an optional chance to get help from a TA or Instructor on your questions, exercises, or projects. They are scheduled for multiple time slots during the week, so that you have a chance to get help with what you are confused about or stuck on, or just get extra feedback on your code.

‚ÅâÔ∏è After each Try Kibo, students say:

> *I wish I had attended office hours sooner!*
> 

Come to office hours as soon as they are available. They are really helpful!
