# Project: Rest of World Landing Page

**Due date: Sunday, July 24**

<aside>


ðŸ‘¥ This is a team project. Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also allowed to work on your own, but itâ€™s good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen, or by creating a new replit and sharing the join link with your teammate. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammateâ€™s version (**which you all created together**!).
