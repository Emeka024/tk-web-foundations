You've already learned a lot about JavaScript this week.

If you have more time, you can also learn about how to publish your website.

You'll learn to:

- Publish your website using Replit or Github Pages
- Use HTML tags to control the preview when you share the link to your site
- Set up a domain name, so that your site shows up when someone types in the URL like [devtools.programming.africa](https://devtools.programming.africa/)

> Only attempt this section if you have completed the JavaScript portion of the lessons.
