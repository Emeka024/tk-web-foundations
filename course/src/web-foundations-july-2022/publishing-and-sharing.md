# Publishing and sharing

*Estimated time: 5 hours*

---

## Intro

In previous classes, we’ve learnt how different technologies can be combined to build cool websites. Now it’s time to give your website the wide visibility it deserves. This week, we’ll be delving into the tools and technologies you’ll be using to publish and share your website with others. 

## **Learning Outcomes**

After this week, you will be able to:

- Publish your website using Replit or Github Pages
- Set up a domain name, so that your site shows up when someone types in the URL like [devtools.programming.africa](https://devtools.programming.africa/)
- Use HTML tags to control the preview when you share the link to your site
