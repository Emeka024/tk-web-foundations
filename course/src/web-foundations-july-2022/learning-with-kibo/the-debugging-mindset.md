Learning programming is challenging! 

On this page, we’ve collected skills, tips, and mindsets that helped students get the most from the program. We hope that they help you too.

## 🐛 Debugging Mindset

> *What we see as a good program with a small bug, the child sees as “wrong”, “bad”, “a mistake”. School teaches that errors are bad; the last thing one wants to do is to pore over them, dwell on them, or think about them. The child is glad to take advantage of a computer’s ability to erase it all without any trace for anyone to see. The debugging philosophy suggests an opposite attitude. **Errors benefit us because they lead us to study what happened, to understand what went wrong, and, through understanding, to fix it**. Experience with computer programming leads children more effectively than any other activity to “believe in” debugging.*

## **When you see errors in your code, how do you feel?**

When you see an error message, or your website doesn’t look the way it should, or your program isn’t doing what you want, it’s natural to feel **scared**, **stressed**, or **frustrated.**

However, errors don’t mean your program is *bad.* They *definitely* don’t mean you are a bad programmer*.* Debugging is the process of making programs better. **Learning to code means running into *lots* of bugs.**

Our version of the Growth Mindset is the **Debugging Mindset**. 

- You will run into lots of errors.
- When you do, treat each one as a chance to learn.
- **Bugs and errors are normal**. Everyone learning to program creates lots of buggy programs — then debugs them. You will too.
