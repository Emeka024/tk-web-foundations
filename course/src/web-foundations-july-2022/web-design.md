---

This is the reading material, practice challenges, and assignment for the second week. 

## **Learning Outcomes**

- Use margin, padding, and border to manage the space between elements
- Layout and position elements on the page
- Choose and apply colors to a webpage

⚠️ **Web Design takes lots of time to learn.**

These lessons have lots of detail, and you won’t be able to remember everything after just one week. 

Try to read the lessons and complete the exercises, but don’t worry if you don’t finish everything. You can skip ahead to the Practice and Project.

As you practice in the future, come back to these lessons and review the material.
