## Keep coding

Remember that programming is a long journey and what matters is to learn well, not fast. And keep practicing!

- Finish the practice assignments from this course, if there are any that you didn‚Äôt get to during these five weeks.
- Take another [Try Kibo](https://kibo.school/trykibo) course like Future Proof With Python
- Practice more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our favorite resources for continuing to learn are
    - [Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/)
    - [Shay Howe‚Äôs Learn HTML and CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
    - [FreeCodeCamp‚Äôs Responsive Web Design Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)
- Apply to Kibo degree program later this year!
- Study computer science in university!
