- **Further Exploration**
    
    If you are finished and still want more, you can go back and revisit the other green boxes, if you skipped over them when reading.
    
    If you’ve done those, and still want to learn more about CSS, check out [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/) from web.dev. It’s a free resource from Google and others that covers CSS topics in even more detail.
    
    We skipped over tons of topics in the lessons. Here’s a few of them, with some links:
    
    - **Responsive Design**
        
        Designing for different screen sizes is hard! MDN has a few guides on strategies for responsive design that you can read.
        
        - [Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) gives an overview.
        - [Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) details how to include images that work well across screen sizes
        - [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) are a core tool you can use to adapt to different screen sizes.
    - **z-index**
        
        When CSS boxes overlap, which one shows up on top? 
        
        The `z-index` property decides.
        
        - The name “z-index”
            
            If x and y are the dimensions on the screen, then the ‘z’ dimension is “popping out” of the screen.
            
        
        `z-index` is tricky to use, in part because it’s hard to see and think about. To learn more about it, check out the [MDN reference on z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index), and the MDN series on [Understanding CSS z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index).
        
    - **Overflow and Scrolling**
        
        Content doesn’t always fit within the width and height of the containing element.
        
        What happens to that overflowing content? It might scroll horizontally or vertically, it might spill out of the containing box, or it might get hidden.
        
        Read more on [MDN about handling overflowing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflowing_content).
        
    - **CSS Grid**
        
        Grid is a popular way of laying out content. 
        
        `grid` is an inside display value that changes the flow of elements inside a container, similar to `flex`.
        
        You can read more about `display: grid` and the [grid layout system on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids).
