# Responding to events in javascript

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

An interactive page needs to change when the user takes an action. In the last lesson, you learned how to change things using JavaScript. The missing piece is to be able to make those changes in response to what the user does.

## Listening For Events

Check out the demo below. Run the program, and be sure to also look at the code.

### `addEventListener`

```jsx
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
	console.log("clicked");
})
```

Events are how JavaScript knows when the user does something. `addEventListener` is how you set up code that will run when that event happens. JavaScript will run the code between the curly braces `{}` when the button is clicked.

## Practice: Hide on click

Access the exercise here: <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://replit.com/team/tk5-web/Hide-on-click" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div> or below

- **Further reading**: Available events
    
    You can listen to more events than just `'click'`. MDN has [a reference page listing all of the available events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). There are a lot!
    

## Debugging

Things donâ€™t always go as planned when writing code. When writing HTML and CSS, you might have learned some tricks that helped you solve problems when things werenâ€™t working as planned. Hereâ€™s some tricks that work in general:

- Make small changes, then run the code to see whatâ€™s changed
- If thereâ€™s an error message, read the message. Try to copy and paste the error message into Google.
- Pay close attention to the syntax. A lot of errors happen because of missing parentheses and brackets, or because of typos.
- Isolate the problem. Try removing code until the problem is gone, then adding things back piece by piece to see which piece was wrong.

Now that youâ€™re writing JavaScript, there are new kinds of bugs, and new tools for debugging them. Here are some strategies that can help:

- Try individual pieces of code in the console to confirm that they work as you expect them to
- Use `alert` and `console.log` to show values at different points in your code, or to make sure that the code is actually running

Itâ€™s even more important that you build solutions piece by piece. The exercises and practice activities are intended to walk you through the pieces step by step. As you get more practice, try planning those steps yourself, then writing code to complete them.
